The program can be used in a rural area. It could be used to monitor animal populations for example. The program works by establishing its neighbours via bluetooth. It automatically picks the best route back to the main IoT device (base) which may have a sim card installed in order to relay information back to anywhere in the world. This networking system is dynamic as it constantly checks identifiers e.g. RSSI to see which nodes are the best to use and passes this new neighbour list along which removes loops. This system needs to be dynamic as these IoT devices mighn’t be collected for years. Some devices batteries may die and as a result, the remaining active devices need to find a new path back to base.
